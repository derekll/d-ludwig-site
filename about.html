			<h1>Personal Bio</h1>
			<p class="top-p">As you've probably realized, I am Derek Ludwig. I've lived in the Toledo area for my whole life and entered the Engineering College at the University of Toledo majoring in Electrical Engineering Technology and Computer Science & Engineering Technology. I'm also active in the UT student sections of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).</p>
			<p class="top-p">I enjoy programming and electronics projects, both for classes and recreationally. While I have made some simple web pages before, I expect this Web Design class to be much more challenging and rewarding.</p>
